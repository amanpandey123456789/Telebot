Project Overview
This project is a Telegram bot developed using the NestJS framework. The bot provides daily weather updates and includes an admin panel for managing bot settings and user accounts. The bot's functionalities include subscribing users for daily weather updates and an admin panel with Google login for authentication. Admins can manage bot settings and user accounts through this panel.

Features
1. Daily Weather Updates:
Users can subscribe to receive daily weather updates.
The bot fetches weather data from an external API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and sends weather information to the subscribed users daily.
2. Admin Panel:
Google Login authentication for the admin.
Admins can manage bot settings such as API keys, configurations, etc.
Admins can manage user accounts, including blocking and deleting users.
Technologies Used
NestJS: Framework for building the bot and admin panel.
TypeScript: Language used for the development of the project.
Telegram Bot API: For communication with Telegram.
Google OAuth: For Admin panel authentication.
PostgreSQL (or any other database): For storing user data and bot settings.
Axios/Fetch: For making HTTP requests to the weather API.
Requirements
Node.js (v14 or above)
NestJS CLI
PostgreSQL (or any other relational database of your choice)
Telegram Bot Token (can be obtained from the BotFather on Telegram)
OpenWeatherMap API Key (or another weather API service)

Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
git clone <your-github-repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
2. Install dependencies:
bash

npm install
3. Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory and include the following variables:

bash
Copy
TELEGRAM_BOT_API_KEY=<your-telegram-bot-api-key>
WEATHER_API_KEY=<your-weather-api-key>
DATABASE_URL=<your-database-connection-string>

Create a PostgreSQL database (or use a preferred database).
Run the migration commands (if using a database ORM like TypeORM).
bash
Copy
npm run migration:run
5. Run the application:
bash
